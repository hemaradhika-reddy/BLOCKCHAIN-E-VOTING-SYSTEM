# BLOCKCHAIN-E-VOTING-SYSTEM
This repository presents developing a Blockchain-based E-Voting System using the SHA-256 encryption algorithm. This provides a resilient and tamper-resistant platform for electronic voting.  Our implementation incorporates the SHA-256 algorithm for encryption, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
